However, if we were to describe 'Phase 1' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it refers to the initial set of interconnected films that laid the foundation for the expansive superhero saga.",
        "description2": "Phase 1 started with Iron man & concluded with 'The Avengers,' which was a monumental success and paved the way for future phases, expanding the MCU into a multi-film franchise that now includes three phases beyond the initial one. As of 2021, the MCU has grown to become one of the most significant and successful film franchises in history , with numerous interconnected films, TV shows, and a wide array of beloved characters.",

Guardians of the Galaxy is set explicitly in 2014. Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man ended the Phase in 2015 and several months passed between the films in-universe as in real life.",
